# SSW345-HW5

## Design

1. Considering different agile design methods prior to the project allowed us to weigh the pros and cons of each and eventually choose a Scrum methodology for our design approach.

2. The most difficult thing was figuring out who was going to do what. As far as breaking the tasks into stories and assigning story points, that was probably easier than figuring out who was doing what. In the future it would be better if everyone was in one spot/call while the tasks were being divided up.

3. Out of all of the agile methodologies I've used, Scrum will most likely be the one I continue using in the future because I feel as though it is the most structured, yet flexible methodology.

## Implementation

1. Having a separate chat channel for bot testing was extremely helpful because we could all easily view the testing of the bot in one space while still not spamming the server overall. This testing helped us find unexpected bugs and ensure that the implementation we intended was achieved.

2. The most difficult part of the implementation was probably the database organization for some of the stories/tasks, but once it was properly set up the rest of the bot functionality was very easy to implement. In the future I'd prefer to get a headstart on the database setup so that the rest of the tasks can be completed earlier.

3. In the future, I'd like to continue having the stories divided up for both implementation and testing because it made it clear what everyone's roles were and helped us stay focused on the tasks we were assigned.

## Process

1. The Kanban board allowed us to to divide our tasks easier than just by word of mouth. It also allowed us to visualize what still needed to be done and what has already been completed. Using Kanban kept the team very organized and allowed for a smooth development process. Code reviews were also helpful because they allowed us to refactor our messy code and work together to overcome any roadblocks a teammate my be faced with. 

2. There was nothing difficult about the bot project that hasn't been previously mentioned. Outside of that however, the timing was a little difficult due to the overlapping with all our other projects and finals. There is nothing I would do differently about the process.

3. Using discord as the platform where our bot was hosted made for an easy time when it came to implementation and testing because every team member could contribute and view what was going on. I would definitely use discord again if I were to make a bot for fun in the future.

## Overall

Using the Kanban board from the Kanban development process was helpful because it let us sort out what needed to be done and what we have already imp,emented and tested. Combining that with the Scrum development cycle was beneficial as well because it kept the iterations/sprints to be completed in a timely manner and made the process smoother overall. It was also beneficial to use Scrum's principle of pair programming for whenever any of the team members would struggle with getting a part of their task done. Overall, the development of this project went well because we took the features of different methodologies that would benefit the team the most and we used them to our advantage.
